# WS2812 Driver
> :warning: Project is currently under development.

The main idea of this project is to create the driver for matrix panel built on top of WS2812-based LED's strips with high refresh rate requirement.

By design, the actual frame buffer is stored on RAM and should be accessed over another serial or parallel interface.
